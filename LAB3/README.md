The main thread spent the exact amount of time my second thread spent. At first I thought this<br />
had to be incorrect but remembered threads of a same process share their address space <br />
bringing both the second thread and main thread.<br />

The time spent in the single thread implementation in homework one actually took less time than <br />
multi-threading. Although this may be true it does not mean single threading is more efficient <br />
to code or exicute<br />

We canâ€™t guarantee the execution order of threads.
